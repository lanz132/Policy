We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except in the following circumstances:

- Service Providers: We may share non-personally identifiable information with trusted third-party service providers that assist us in operating the App (e.g., analytics services). These third parties are obligated to keep your information confidential and use it only for the services they provide to us.
